# Raft
Trying my hand at implementing aspects of raft paper

## Getting started

I'll mainly be following this [blog](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/implementing-raft-part-1-elections/) from Eli and the theory from the original [paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf).

Additionally, I dont have much experience in implementation in GO. I'll rely on documentation and [go.dev](https://go.dev/tour/moretypes/1)
